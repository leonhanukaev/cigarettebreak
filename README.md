    all the functions in the provided code, including main, are defined at the same indentation level. None of them are nested under any classes or functions. They are all defined at the top level of the module.

the script does not require any additional external libraries or packages. It relies on standard Python libraries and modules such as sys, time, and subprocess.

9/1 - the script does not loop and needs to be reset manually (working on a loop feature)

working on the bar (modified the countdown function with the following: 
progress = (total_seconds - seconds) / total_seconds
    progress_bar = "üîµ" * int(progress * 20) + "‚ö™" * (20 - int(progress * 20))
    print(f"{minutes:02}:{seconds:02} ‚è∞ [{progress_bar}] {int(progress * 100)}%", end="\r") )
